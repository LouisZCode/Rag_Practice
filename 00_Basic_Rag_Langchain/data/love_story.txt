The Cultivation Continues - Story Summary
Setting & Characters
Time: 1920s Massachusetts, near Arkham
Protagonist: A desperate farmer (unnamed), his pregnant wife Sarah, and their young son Thomas
Tone: Lovecraftian cosmic horror with slow-building dread
Plot Overview
A once-prosperous farmer faces catastrophic crop failure in 1923. As his family starves and Sarah's pregnancy weakens her further, he discovers a mysterious hole behind the old colonial cemetery on his property. Driven by desperation and a supernatural "call," he descends into the earth on August 17th.
Seventy feet down, he finds an impossible underground chamber—a grotesque alien farm with massive pale roots and bizarre vegetables growing in darkness, illuminated by a sickly, otherworldly light from a crystalline altar. He takes one of the vegetables and an ancient book covered in geometric symbols.
The Twist: He returns home two days later, though he experienced only hours underground.
The Horror Unfolds
The family eats the vegetable and survives. The farmer plants a portion—it grows with unnatural speed, producing seven more in ten days. But consumption has consequences:

Thomas becomes obsessed with the book, copying its symbols on walls, claiming he can read the alien language about "cultivation" and "exchange"
Sarah's pregnancy accelerates horrifically—five months to full term in two weeks, her body consumed from within
The Farmer experiences disturbing changes, drawn back to the hole, whispering in unknown languages

Rain traps them for fourteen days. Then massive pale roots attack the house, seeking to claim them. Thomas reveals the truth: they've violated an ancient exchange. The book must be returned.
The Climax
The Farmer descends again. The chamber has transformed into a cathedral of organic architecture. A cosmic consciousness communicates directly into his mind: The vegetables were gifts. The book was theft. But the real debt is consumption—they ate of the deep-harvest, and now the deep will harvest them.
The entity reveals the terrible truth: Thomas has been prepared to become a "surface-child"—a bridge between worlds who will restore the ancient cultivation. Sarah's accelerated pregnancy will birth a hybrid creature. The exchange cannot be undone.
The Ending
The Farmer returns to find Thomas gone—descended willingly into the depths. Sarah goes into agonizing labor and births an inhuman thing: pale, glistening, marked with alien symbols, with hollow eyes that glow with that same sickly light. The birth kills her.
In his final journal entry, the Farmer accepts his fate. He will take the creature below and stay with Thomas in the depths, offering himself to the cultivation. He writes a warning about places that should remain undisturbed and exchanges that should never be proposed.
Epilogue: An archival note states the farmhouse was found abandoned three months later. No bodies recovered. Seven patches of the grotesque vegetables discovered in the fields. Thomas and his father were never found. Local legends speak of pale figures near the cemetery and sounds from beneath the earth during the dark of the moon.
